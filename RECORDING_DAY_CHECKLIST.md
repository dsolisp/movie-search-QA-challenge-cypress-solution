## WHAT IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG?

**"I messed up mid-sentence"**
- Stop, take a breath, start again. You can edit/re-record in Loom.

**"My voice sounds weird/rushed"**
- Totally normal! Re-record. You'll do better on take 2.

**"I forgot a key point"**
- That's why you have the script. Take another pass.

**"Technical glitch?"**
- Restart Loom, restart from that section. No big deal.

**"Feel like I need more takes?"**
- Do 2-3 takes of each, then pick the best one. This is your presentation!
